# HTML CSS Code Refractor

In this project, I refactor existing code made by Horiseon to improve their code base for longterm sustainability by using semantics tags in HTML to improve the assessibility and functionality of elements on the Homepage. I removed redundancies in the CSS file for more concise and compact code following one simeple rule:

> Always leave the code you are editing a little cleaner than you found it.
